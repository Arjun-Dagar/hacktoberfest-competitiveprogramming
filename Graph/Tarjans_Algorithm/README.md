# Tarjan's Algorithm for strongly connected components.

### What is Strongly Connected Component? 
A strongly connected component is the portion of a directed graph in which there is a path from each vertex to another vertex. It is applicable only on a directed graph.

#### What is Tarjan's Algorithm? 
Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory for finding the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a directed graph. It runs in linear time, matching the time bound for alternative methods including Kosaraju's algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm.
