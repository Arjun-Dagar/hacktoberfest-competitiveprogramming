# Trapping Water/Rain Problem

This is a very popular question that is often asked in interviews and is based on array. You are given an array and the size of the array. Each index is having a number which
tells us the height of the block at the index. The blocks at both the end acts as the border for the container. We have to determine how much water we can store in the array/container.

## Example 1: 
**INPUT**
Array = {5,0,6,2,3} , size = 5
**Output**
6 ltrs
